    	<h1>What Now?</h1>
    	<p class="intro">It's time to settle down. I feel that my life has been a series of lives. From music to golf to the office and classroom. I've had a lot of experiences and they haven't borne much relationship to each other.</p>
    	<p class="intro">To break from that pattern I'm going to launch a completely new career. Hence Galvanize.</p>
    	<p class="intro">That may be tongue in cheek but I do have the general impression that this is a route on which I'll stay. I'm feeling pretty good about it... see background.</p>
    	<p class="quiet">P.S. I know it's busy and distracting. Who uses a gif as a background anyway? I do, that's who. Because YOLO.</p>
    	<p class="intro">Anyway, this whole stick to a life plan thing is a weird thought for me. But let's play it out.</p>

        <h2>Who we will be</h2>
        <p>I am a father of three now. We had a son and adopted another daughter. I couldn't seem to turn off that part of my brain that wants to keep creating things to address everyday inconveniences. So I, once again, work for myself. More on that later. I also consult for my wife, who has a non-profit that does cultural and mental health training for groups preparing to embark on international relief work. Mostly churches. They're an easy sell.</p>
		<p>We actually do a lot of music for those churches as well. Which is fun in a town like Nashville.</p>

        <h2>Where we will be</h2>
        <p>Oh yeah, and we live in Nashville. It wasn't my first choice. Or second or third or fourth or any. But have you seen housing prices in Tennessee? Plus it worked better for our professional goals. My wife had an easy time convincing me. And I don't know if you've ever had "hot chicken" but it is an end unto itself. Also it's a short drive to the world's best pancakes. Aretha Frankenstein's in Chattanooga. If you get the chance... you'll thank me.</p>

        <h2>What we will do</h2>
        <p>For a day job I run an entrepreneur accelerator for at-risk students. The students mostly come from the Javascript class I teach at the local highschool. Kind of a glorified after school program, keeps them out of trouble but also gets them some pretty marketable skills. They go on to start businesses in the neighborhoods in which they grew up. It's a model that's gotten some attention accross the state.</p>
		
		<p>I have worked with some friends to create a few products and did get one modest exit from one of them. We developed a pretty lightweight algorithm for navigation and routing that focused on minimizing carbon emissions/energy costs taking into account traffic, traffic lights and other stops, the type of vehicle, and elevation changes. Consumers weren't that interested but a company that has a big operation distributing snack foods was pretty into it. Not sexy but it paid the bills.</p>
