    <h1>What on Earth Happened to Patrick?</h1>
		<p class="intro">If you ever have the pleasure of capturing an adult Red-tailed Hawk you'll notice first how mesmerizing and penetrating her eyes are.<br><br>You'll next realize that the hypnosis isn't just because of her direct eye contact and the amber hue.<br><br>It's because though the hand with which you hold her feet is nervously fidgeting, her body moving around with it, her eyes, and indeed her entire head, are perfectly still.<br><br>I think of my life that way... wavering and frantic, a roller coaster, really. Somehow, I'm not affected.</p><br>
		<p class="intro">Ugh. No sense in trying to be deep. Let's just get to it.</p>

        <h2>Who I've Been</h2>
        <p>This is my family. Not all of us, of course. Just the essential staff. I have 16 neices and nephews and I'm actually one of 8 kids. I was the fourth boy. Michael, Christopher, Jason then me, Patrick. After me, for whatever reason, they decided it would be a good idea to adopt the rest. Two girls, Monique and Angel, and two more boys, Austin and Quam&eacute;. That last name means born on Saturday.</p>
        <p>He was born on a Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Pictured is my wife Charity, my kid Juliet, and me. My wife's a therapist and my kid's crazy, so we're a good group.</p>

        <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
        <p>We moved here from Augusta, Georgia. And I moved there from Cleveland. And I moved there from a string of other places after I was born in Connecticut about an hour from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The plan was to finish grad school here in Denver, then move back to the East Coast. But as it turns out, Colorado is a great place to stay and Georgia is a fantastic place to never return.</p>

        <h2>What I've Done</h2>
        <p>I think of my life as charmed. I've been a musician who's performed on some of Nashville's and New Orleans' biggest stages. I've been a Golf Pro who's played the Masters Tees at the Augusta National. I've climbed the Great Wall of China and eaten Halo-Halo on the streets of Manilla. Sipped coffee next to heavily armed guards in Jamaica. Worse, I paid $12 for an Earl Grey tee bag in Seoul.</p>
		<p>I've been to a lot of hospitals to welcome life and say goodbye.</p>
   		<p>Had a week long stint or two in modelling. I don't recommend it. I've been a teacher and an analyst. A freelance web developer and a restaurant server. I've sold jeans and shipping containers full of wine.</p>
   		<p>I don't drink or smoke but from time to time I've been known to keep up with the Kardashians... That Khloe just understands me.</p>
   		<p>My first time abroad my passport was stolen. I am a cautionary tale to any students of Daniels College of Business embarking on international travel.</p>
